# Udacity-Projects
1. The first project was for Introduction to Data Science at Western Governor's University. We were tasked with investigating a data set of our choice, we used Python and a Jupyter notebook to document our findings.
2. The second course that was part of the Udacity nano-degree was Data Visualization using Tableau. The following  link can be used to view a Tableau Story that I created to explore the relationship between height, weight, and hand dominance with average home runs and average batting average.
